This is a port of [@sailorhg](http://sailorhg.com/)'s [fairyfloss](https://sailorhg.github.io/fairyfloss/) theme for the [micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/) terminal based editor.

It is a truecolor (24-bit color) terminal theme although **micro** will try to map it to 256 colors if that isn't available.

# Installation

To install, place the *fairyfloss-tc.micro* file into the *~/.config/micro/colorschemes* directory.

Press *Ctrl-E* in **micro** to bring up the command prompt, and type:

    set colorscheme fairyfloss-tc
